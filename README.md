# f1000-test
Exercise from F1000
Exercise
This is a practical exercise to test your programming and design skills. You should
implement the following features using Java. There is no need to persist any data to a
database or to build a user interface. You should prove your code works by unit testing it to
cover the features listed below. Automating your unit testing with Maven or Ant would be
preferable.
You have been asked to add a new feature to F1000 which provides the ability to rank
journals.
Feature: Rank journals
In order to highlight the journals which have the biggest impact in a given year
As a user
I want to be able to see journals ordered by their score across a range of years. If two or
more journals have the same score they should be assigned the same rank, ordering within
a rank should be done alphabetically on the journalâ€™s name.
Scenario 1: Rank journals
Given the following journals have scores for 2015:
Journal A = 5.6, Journal B = 2.4, Journal C = 3.1
When the user views the ranked journals
Then the order and rank should be:
Rank Journal Score
1 Journal A 5.6
2 Journal C 3.1
3 Journal B 2
